 <h2>The Last Page of Granny’s Grimoire: A Tale of Hazel and Red.</h2>
        <br />

      <p class="green">When Red’s girlfriend, Hazel, vanishes into the Enchanted Forest, Red knows who’s behind it
         the Big Bad Wolf. With Granny’s ancient grimoire strapped to her side, Red sets off to
          rescue Hazel, guided by whispers of old spells and spirits that linger in the woods.
           Every page she turns reveals more of Granny’s secrets and the truth about the magic
            that binds them all.

The forest itself becomes her greatest challenge, shifting with illusions, puzzles, and enchanted
 creatures who test Red’s courage and wit. To move forward, she must help the forest’s spirits,
  solve magical riddles, and recover lost memories hidden within glowing orbs scattered through
   the mist. Each memory brings her closer to Hazel and closer to understanding what the Wolf truly
    wants.

In the final confrontation beneath a blood-red moon, Red faces the Wolf not with rage, but with the magic 
of forgiveness and strength passed down from Granny. As the last spell from the grimoire is cast, the Wolf’s 
curse shatters and he transforms into a helpless puppy. With Hazel safe in her arms, Red closes the grimoire,
 knowing that love and courage have rewritten the final page of their story.</p>
