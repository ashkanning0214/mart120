There are two different types of user interfaces GUI, which stands for Graphical User Interface, and CLI, which stands for Command Line Interface. Each offers different levels of user experience and presents unique limitations depending on the user's needs.

GUIs use visuals like icons and buttons. They are ideal for beginners and make multitasking much easier, but they tend to use more memory. While commands in a CLI can be quicker to type, navigating through GUI menus can be slower for experienced users.

The CLI has its own advantages, such as allowing users to perform tasks quickly using only keyboard commands. It also consumes less memory and processing power. However, mistyped commands can lead to unintended consequences if users are not careful. CLI has a steep learning curve and is not recommended for those unfamiliar with command-line syntax.
