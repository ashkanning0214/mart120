Communication is more important than ever in both our personal and professional lives especially now that so much of it happens digitally rather than face-to-face. I’ve definitely been misunderstood in texts, emails, or direct messages. It happens! When it does, I try to respond with compassion and clarify what I meant. Most of the time, a thoughtful reply can smooth things over quickly.
I use a few different ways to stay in touch with friends and family whether it’s messaging through TikTok, texting from my iPhone, or hopping on video chats. I especially love video chats with my mom and brother. Since we live hours or even states apart, seeing each other makes it easier to connect in a more natural way than just talking on the phone. As a millennial, I use “lol” a lot in messages not because I’m laughing, but to show I’m not upset or to soften the tone of what I’m saying. Emojis help too! They add emotion and context that words alone sometimes miss. Digital communication isn’t perfect, but with a little empathy and the right tools, it’s possible to stay close and clear even across miles.
