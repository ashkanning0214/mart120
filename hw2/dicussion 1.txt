Some of what the speaker said made sense to me, and some of it felt more like it was meant for neurotypical people. I really liked the part about brick walls not being there to stop you, but to show how much you want something. If you push through, it means you care enough to keep going.

I also noticed how he worded things. Like when he said, “being a jerk will limit what you can accomplish.” That’s way more helpful than just calling someone a jerk. It gives people a chance to think about their behavior and maybe change it.

The story about being pushed hard in football practice stuck with me too. The assistant coach said that being pushed means someone cares, and if no one says anything, it might mean they’ve given up. That made me wonder how many people given up on me?

Another line I liked was, experience is what you get when you didn’t get what you wanted. It’s a better way of saying we learn from failure, without all the negativity that word usually brings.

Watching this video didn’t give me all the answers, but it did help me ask better questions about how I learn, how I connect with others, and what kind of support actually helps. Some parts felt like they weren’t made for people like me, but even then, I found ways to make the ideas fit. It reminded me that growth isn’t one size fits all, and that I’m still figuring out what pushing through looks like for me. The ending was also really cute about how everything he said was for his kids.
