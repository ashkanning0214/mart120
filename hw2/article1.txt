After reading this article, I don’t think learning styles really matter as much as people want to believe. The research shows that even when students know their supposed learning style, most of them don’t study in ways that match it, and even the ones who do don’t perform any better. That makes me think learning styles are more about preference than actual effectiveness. For example, I consider myself a very tactile learner, but I’ve found that flashcards or even flashcard apps actually work really well for me. I’m also dyslexic, so sometimes that gets in the way of remembering things correctly, but the repetition from flashcards helps me strengthen what I’ve learned. This makes me realize that it’s not always about a “learning style label,” but about finding strategies that truly support comprehension. What seems to matter more are techniques that work for everyone, like spreading out study time, testing yourself, and making meaningful connections with the material.

You are a Tactile learner! Check out the information below, or view all of the learning styles.

Tactile
Tactile learners prefer hands-on activities, physical movement, and learning through touch. You excel when engaged in active, dynamic learning experiences, often requiring breaks, and may find it challenging to sit still.

As a tactile learner, you enjoy hands-on activities such as dismantling and assembling things. When you are bored, you tend to tinker or move around. Your good coordination and athletic ability stand out. While you easily recall actions, visual or auditory information might be challenging. Touch is your preferred communication style, and you appreciate physical forms of encouragement, like a pat on the back.

Here are some things that tactile learners like you can do to learn better:

Participate in activities that involve touching, building, moving, or drawing.
Do lots of hands-on activities like completing art projects, taking walks, or acting out stories.
It's okay to chew gum, walk around, or rock in a chair while reading or studying.
Use flashcards and arrange them in groups to show relationships between ideas.
Trace words with your finger to learn spelling (finger spelling).
Take frequent breaks during reading or studying periods (frequent, but not long).
It's okay to tap a pencil, shake your foot, or hold on to something while learning.
Use a computer to reinforce learning through the sense of touch.
Remember that you learn best by doing, not just by reading, seeing, or hearing.
