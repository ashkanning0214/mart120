After reading this article, I can see how much culture really does impact learning. It made sense to me that if people don’t feel their culture is represented or respected, they may not connect with what’s being taught or transfer it into practice. As a nonbinary student, and also someone who has dyslexia and ADHD, I know what it feels like when my needs and identity aren’t considered in the learning environment. Sometimes the way material is presented doesn’t fit how I process it, which makes things harder. I’ve had to find my own strategies, like using flashcards and apps, even though I’m a very tactile learner. Being in a queer relationship with another nonbinary person also makes me think a lot about inclusion and how often systems and classrooms are set up in ways that don’t reflect who we are. For me, the cultural side of learning connects to the idea that everyone brings unique experiences, identities, and challenges into the classroom. If teachers and leaders acknowledge that and plan for it, students will feel more included and supported. What stood out most in this article was the idea that culture is everywhere in time, traditions, communication, and even in who is seen as the knower. That made me think about how important it is for learning spaces to be flexible and welcoming, not just focused on one right way of doing things.
